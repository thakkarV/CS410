Assignment 1

Make sure to read the submission instructions: Submission Instructions.

This is a very simple assignment to familiarize yourself with compiling a C program and properly submitting an assignment (see Submission Instructions). You will also learn how to use command line arguments in C. You will be creating a very basic version of the echo program. You will have to support one command line option -n, which omits the trailing newline.

echo is a very simple program that prints the command line arguments passed to it, see man echo for more detail. As previously stated you only need to support the -n option and therefore do not have to worry about backslash escaped characters.

Building a basic C program will be discussed in the first lab along with Makefiles.

The assignment will be submitted via gsubmit which can be found on csa2. The directory the assignment should be submitted under is a1 and the program should be called my_echo.

The assignment is due September 13th at 5AM.

A test script can be found here. The test script will first run make clean then make and then repeatedly run my_echo and compare the results to the output of echo. The test script is a python script. You must change the permission of the script so you can execute it: chmod +x a1_test_script.py and run the script ./a1_test_script.py in your a1 directory. The test script is how your assignment will be graded, with additional test cases added. Please ensure that your Makefile and program work with the test script otherwise your assignment will not be graded.
